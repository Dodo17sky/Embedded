## Quick introduction

Our purpose is to implement different projects based on STM32F103 microcontrollers. For this, we first create some basic drivers (GPIO, RCC, UART, SPI, etc) and then on an upper layer we will create different applications (Light Controller, Data Router, Display Controller, etc)
